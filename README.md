## Overview

This is an Environmental Finance service that allows individuals to track their carbon footprint. The Enfin team is redefining individuals' methods towards watching their impact on the environment. Using estimations based on the current environmental research, every dollar spent can be mapped to an environmental impact. 

## History 

Enfin was founded while at the [Impact Labs Fellowship](https://www.impactlabs.io/fellowship). The fellowship is designed for passionate and motivated students to come to together and combine computer science and social good, learning to create the humanitarian software development. The founders had a strong idea regarding the effects individuals can have on Climate Change, and Enfin highlights this belief.
